    Generator for simulating vertical motion to calculate apogee (max altitude).
    
    This is a simplified 1D vertical dynamics model (z-down convention, w positive down? Wait, adjust:
    Actually, for rockets, z often up, w positive up. Here: assume z up, w positive up.
    Adapted from translational eq for vertical (w dot = -g + (T - D cos alpha - L sin alpha)/m, but simplified.
    For coast: T=0, if alpha=0, L=0, then dot_w = -g - D/m (if D opposes motion).
    
    Full integration until w <= 0 (apogee when w crosses from + to -).
    Yields dict with 'z' (altitude), 'w' (vertical velocity), 't' (time), 'apogee_reached' (bool),
    'apogee_altitude' (z at apogee, updated when reached).
    
    For burn phase, set T >0; for coast, T=0.
    Drag D and lift L can be fixed or passed anew in full sim.
    
    Quick estimate on first yield if desired, but here focuses on simulation.
    
    Args:
        initial_z: Initial altitude (m, positive up)
        initial_w: Initial vertical velocity (m/s, positive up)
        g: Gravity (m/sÂ²)
        m: Mass (kg)
        T: Thrust (N, along body; projected to vertical if theta=0)
        D: Drag magnitude (N)
        alpha: Angle of attack (rad)
        L: Lift magnitude (N)
        dt: Time increment (s)
        num_steps: Max steps (default infinite)
        tolerance: Velocity threshold for apogee detection
